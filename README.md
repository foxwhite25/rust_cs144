# CS144: Introduction to Computer Networking; Rust Edition

After I read the manual, the C++ style guide and best practices seems familiar,
it is just like using rust, but without annoying syntax from C++.

This is why this repository is created, to record my journey though cs144 in Rust.

## Test-cases

These test-cases are generated by GPT to convert from C++ to Rust,
I provided enough context for it to know what method is the equivalent in rust.
But it still makes mistakes, because it is GPT. I am tired of fixing test-cases bug
created by GPT, so this is most of the test-cases, but not all,
although most likely the code would work with all of them.

## Progress

Currently, only lab 0..=3 was implemented,
because that is all I need for the task of choose 4 from 7 tasks,
which by the way is so idiotic as these are not independent tasks
but continuous journey though TCP,
you can't do just do some of them.

I may revisit them after the exam, and implement them just for fun.
